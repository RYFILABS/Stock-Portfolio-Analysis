Stock Portfolio Analysis

The purpose of the script is to analyze my current stock portfolio and forecast the future value of my portfolio.

In order to create this script, I will need to connect to an API.

Use the Alpaca Trade API for this.

Use S&P 500 and NASDAQ historical data for market performance data.

Then, I will run individual monte carlo simulations for each stock in my portfolio individually and compare these individual performances.

Join this performance data together and run simulations to forecast my potential portfolio performance with these same stocks.

Run an additional simulation with assigning new weights to the stocks in my current portfolio.

Next, I will adjust the weights of each stock to make them a bit more level.

Then I will drop my 2 worst performing stocks and rerun my analysis.

Lastly, put together a visualization showing the comparison between my current portfolio, current portfolio rebalanced, and optimized portfolio.

Run simulations on Gold and BTCUSD for investment comparison.
